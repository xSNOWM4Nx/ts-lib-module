# ts-lib-module
An open-source project written in TypeScript.

This project represents my standard library for generic type definitions and patterns that I use in various other projects. It can be obtained from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@danielneuweiler/ts-lib-module) or distributed as a development package with the scripts.
